      }
    }
    // ... other plans
  ]
}
```

### 2. Setup Pricing Plans in Stripe

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 3. Start Free Trial
```http
POST /api/payments/subscriptions/trial/
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customer_email": "user@example.com",
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "price_id": "price_1234567890",
  "metadata": {
    "user_type": "trial_user"

  "price_id": "price_1234567890",
  "trial_period_days": 7
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Stripe Configuration

The pricing plans are created in Stripe with the following structure:

#### Products
- RecruiterAI Starter Plan
- RecruiterAI Standard Plan
- RecruiterAI Enterprise Plan

#### Prices (per product)
- Monthly subscription price
- Yearly subscription price (30% discount)

### Metadata Structure

Each plan includes comprehensive metadata:
```json
{
  "plan_type": "starter|standard|enterprise",
  "job_posts_per_year": "36|120|360",
  "support_level": "email",
  "trial_days": "7",
  "billing_interval": "monthly|yearly"
}
```

## ðŸ’³ Free Trial Implementation

### Trial Features
- **Duration**: 7 days
- **No credit card required** during setup
- **1 job post included** during trial
- **Automatic conversion** to paid plan after trial (if payment method added)

### Trial Workflow
1. User selects a plan
2. System creates Stripe customer
3. Creates subscription with 7-day trial
4. User can use 1 job post during trial
5. After 7 days, subscription becomes active (requires payment)

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Integration

### 1. Display Pricing Plans
```javascript
// Fetch pricing plans
const response = await fetch('/api/payments/pricing/plans/');
const data = await response.json();

// Display plans
data.plans.forEach(plan => {
  console.log(`${plan.name}: ${plan.monthly_price_formatted}`);
});
```

### 2. Start Free Trial
```javascript
const startTrial = async (planType, userEmail) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/payments/subscriptions/trial/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      customer_email: userEmail,
      price_id: getPriceId(planType, 'monthly'), // or 'yearly'
      customer_name: userName
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Trial started successfully!');
  }
};
```

### 3. Handle Payment After Trial
```javascript
// This would integrate with Stripe Elements for payment
const handlePayment = async (subscriptionId, paymentMethodId) => {
  // Update subscription with payment method
  // This would be a separate endpoint for payment processing
};
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All subscription endpoints require authentication
- Pricing plans endpoint is public for display
- Setup endpoint restricted to admin users

### Data Validation
- Email validation for customer creation
- Plan type validation against allowed values
- Price ID validation against Stripe

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for Stripe failures
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- Proper HTTP status codes

## ðŸ“Š Usage Analytics

### Tracking Metrics
- Trial conversion rates
- Popular plan selections
- Monthly vs yearly preferences
- Feature usage during trials

### Metadata for Analytics
Each subscription includes metadata for tracking:
```json
{
  "trial_type": "free_trial",
  "trial_started": "true",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "plan_type": "starter",
  "source": "web_app"
}
```
